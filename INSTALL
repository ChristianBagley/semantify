Required dependencies:
- Python 2.7 (may work on older ones as well, but not tested)
- Python libraries
  - sqlite3 

Optional dependencies:
- SciKit if you want to calculate F-scores (sklearn to be precise)

Installation
1) Get the sources

In some suitable directory:
> git clone https://github.com/okohonen/semantify

2) Package the firefox extension
> cd semantify
> make

3) Install the Firefox extension
- In Firefox select: "Open File"
- Choose the file semantify/client.xpi created in the previous step
- Choose Install Now
- You will need to restart Firefox to complete the installation
- After restart, the semantify-extension should show up in the
  bookmarks toolbar as a small blue icon with a white "s". You may need
  to add it to the toolbar from the "Customize"-menu

Usage:
1) Start the backend component

> cd client/backend
> python semantify_server.py

(Should say "serving at port 50010")

2) (Re)start Firefox
- From the Semantify-menu:
  - Create new model
    - Choose an appropriate dtd-file describing your desired
      annotation-categories. Some examples are available in the
      directory semantify/client/samples
    - Start tagging as with WebAnnotator
    - Once done the tagging can be stored in the backend's page index by
      choosing "Store page tags" from the semantify-menu, which
      initiates the training of a tagger
    - A tagger can be applied to a page using "Tag Page"
      - NOTE: If the training set is very small, e.g. < 10 pages,
        automatic tagging is likely to still yield no taggings, but this
        corrects itself with more annotated pages.
    - Models are automatically stored in the backend if there is at
      least one annotated page for that model
      - NOTE: If the semantify_server.py is not running when Firefox
        starts up, then the Firefox extension cannot retrieve these
	stored models, and one needs to restart Firefox to access
	them.
      - Should semantify_server.py crash during some operation it can
        generally be restarted without needing to restart Firefox (so
	as not to lose annotations because of a server crash)
