Semantify is a tool for the construction of custom, machine learning taggers
for web pages. Semantify extends WebAnnotator, "a tool for annotating Web pages",
implemented as a Firefox extension (http://perso.limsi.fr/xtannier/en/WebAnnotator/). 
We have lightly modified the WebAnnotator UI is to integrate with
with a machine learning based tagger, implemented in Python. The Firefox extension 
sends the user's annotations to a tagger component that is then trained to
perform the same tagging.

Disclaimer:
This is a proof-of-concept implementation, not mature software. Using
it requires some technical knowledge (mainly ability to use the shell).

Semantify has been developed by:
Oskar Kohonen, Srikrishna Raamadhurai and Teemu Ruokolainen at Aalto
University, Helsinki, Finland

Known bugs:
- Save&Export is not working

Known issues:
- The feature functions currently implemented are best suited to
  discover fields in a web-page. 
  The current implementation is lacking in good features that enable: 
    1) Generalizing tagging to include synonyms or related words 
    2) Generalization from sentence-level structure, such as
       part-of-speech 
    3) Any kind of morphological analysis

We hope these will be addressed in the future.
